# Mod Mail Bot in Python

#  Brief
This bot is made alone by me in just 2 days. It is made to provide discord servers a better system to provide support to their members!

# Installation

Bot requires latest version of discord.py.

Install the dependencies to start the bot.

```sh
pip install discord.py
pip install json
```
Put the various things required in config.json placed in utilities folder.

When bot joins your server simply run setup command with the prefix you allocated in it.
```sh
python main.py
```
